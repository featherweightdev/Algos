# My algorithm practice repo

As I go through several methods of learning algos, I keep track of my solutions in this repo.
The problems come from various sources:

1. Algo Expert
2. Specific company algo questions
3. Code wars
4. Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman McDowell (book)
5. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steele (Udemy course - highly recommended!)
6. Pramp.com interview platform

Feel free to look through, and reach out to me with corrections, challenges and suggestions!
